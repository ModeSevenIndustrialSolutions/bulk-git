# bulk-git

Scripts for performing bulk GIT/GitHub operations:

- clonefork.sh - clones/forks an entire organisation (optionally into another ORG)
- emptyorg.sh - deletes all repositories from a GitHub organisation (use with care!)
- raisepr.sh - can be used to bulk raise the same pull request across repositories
- refresh.sh - nukes origin main/master branch and syncs with upstream
