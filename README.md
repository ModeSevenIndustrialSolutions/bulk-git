# bulk-git

Scripts for performing bulk GIT/GitHub operations:

- bulkchange.sh - can raise and merge bulk changes in GitHub repositories
- cloneforkgithub.sh - clones/forks an entire GitHub organisation (optionally into another ORG)
- clonegerrit.sh - clones an entire Gerrit server estate, preserving the repository hierarchy
- common.sh - common functions used by all scripts (work in progress)
- emptyorg.sh - deletes all repositories from a GitHub organisation (use with care!)
- raisepr.sh - can be used to bulk raise pull requests in GitHub (deprecated)
- refresh.sh - updates cloned/forked repositories; re-syncs main/master branches with upstream
